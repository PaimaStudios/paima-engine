// Fold a ladder of maker offers into ONE settlement.
//
// Taking N offers used to mean N separate settlements, back to back. The
// taker's JS wallet usually holds a single coin per token, and nothing tells it
// about take #k's spend before take #k+1 is balanced — the template submits
// through the batcher, not `facade.submitTransaction`, so the facade's coin
// selection still offers up the coin that was just spent. The node saw the same
// nullifier twice and rejected the second settlement with
// `Zswap(NullifierAlreadyPresent)`: only the first offer of a ladder was ever
// bought.
//
// ZSwap offers are built to compose. An offer blob decodes to a finalized,
// deliberately imbalanced maker transaction, and ledger `merge` places two of
// them side by side — the batcher already merges its dust intent into every
// transaction, and `finalizeRecipe` merges the taker's balancing half into the
// maker's. Folding the N maker halves FIRST and balancing the result once means
// one coin selection, one proof pass, one dust fee and one submission: the
// double-spend window is removed rather than waited out.
//
// The one limit is segment ids. The facade builds an offer's unshielded half
// with `Transaction.fromParts`, which always lands its Intent at segment 1, and
// `merge` refuses two transactions that both occupy it ("key (segment_id)
// collision during intents merge: 1"). Shielded-only offers carry no Intent at
// all, so they always compose. Re-segmenting is not an option on this side: it
// needs an unproven transaction, and a maker blob decodes to a bound one
// ("Transaction is already bound."). A batch that would collide is therefore
// rejected HERE, before anything is submitted — a ladder settles whole or not
// at all.
//
// BOTH wallets fold their ladder through this module. The JS wallet facade
// takes the merged ledger object (services/localTradeOffers.ts); Lace takes its
// serialized bytes and picks a balancing strategy from its shape
// (services/browserOffers.ts), which is why `pickSwapSegment` and
// `chooseLaceBalancing` live here too — a merged transaction has to satisfy the
// same dispatch a single offer did, and that is something a unit test can check
// without a wallet in the room.
