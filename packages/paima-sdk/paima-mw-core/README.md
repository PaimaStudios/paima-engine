# Paima Middleware Core

Middleware to facilitate connection of frontends written for games using Paima with a game node.

You can find the full docs for Paima [here](https://docs.paimastudios.com/). \
**Note**: We generally recommend using [@paima/sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@paima/sdk) instead of this SDK to get all Paima features as a single package.
