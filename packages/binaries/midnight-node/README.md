# @effectstream/npm-midnight-node

NPM wrapper that downloads and runs the
[Midnight](https://midnight.network/) Node binary. Installs a pinned
version on first invocation and exposes a `npm-midnight-node` CLI for
the EffectStream orchestrator and templates.

- Pinned Midnight node binary (`2.0.0-rc.4`), downloaded on first run.
- Native targets are `macos-arm64` and `linux-amd64`; no Linux arm64 asset is published.
- `--dev` for a local node; `--clean-binaries` / `--only-clean` to manage the cache.
- Consumed by `@effectstream/sync`'s `MidnightFetcher`.
- Templates: `evm-midnight-v2`, `night-bitcoin`, `zswap-da`, `zk-cardano`.

## Cached-chain compatibility

This node is the Ledger-9 member of the bundled tuple declared by
`@effectstream/npm-midnight-indexer/compatibility.json`. Node-1/Ledger-8 chain
state is not reusable by node `2.0.0-rc.4`. In the pinned reproduction, that
state made the node exit nonzero with a missing
`ext_ledger_8_bridge_construct_distribute_treasury_system_tx_version_1` host
import. Do not label other startup failures incompatible without that exact
evidence.

The current Effectstream launcher supplies the installed indexer package's
single compatibility declaration to this wrapper. The wrapper tees the native
node output, waits for the child, and propagates its nonzero/signal result. It
emits the incompatible-cache diagnosis only when it observes the declaration's
exact verified signal; otherwise the result remains a known node child failure
with an instruction to inspect the node log.

The Effectstream orchestrator passes an explicit project-local `BASE_PATH`:
`packages/contracts-midnight/node_modules/.cache/effectstream/midnight-node`.
If a reset is necessary, stop the stack, archive or remove only that directory,
then restart. The orchestrator and indexer never reset it automatically, and
indexer `--clean` does not affect it.

## Install

```bash
bun add @effectstream/npm-midnight-node
# or
npm install @effectstream/npm-midnight-node
```

## Standalone usage

```bash
# Start a local Midnight node (downloads the binary on first run)
bunx npm-midnight-node --dev

# Clear the downloaded binary cache
bunx npm-midnight-node --clean-binaries

# Only clean, don't redownload
bunx npm-midnight-node --only-clean
```

## Inside EffectStream

The orchestrator's Midnight step starts this binary, plus
`@effectstream/npm-midnight-proof-server` and
`@effectstream/npm-midnight-indexer`, then `@effectstream/sync`'s
`MidnightFetcher` consumes the node's RPC. Templates that target
Midnight:

- [`templates/evm-midnight-v2/`](https://github.com/effectstream/effectstream/tree/main/templates/evm-midnight-v2)
- [`templates/night-bitcoin/`](https://github.com/effectstream/effectstream/tree/main/templates/night-bitcoin-v2)
- [`templates/zswap-da/`](https://github.com/effectstream/effectstream/tree/main/templates/zswap-da)
- [`templates/zk-cardano/`](https://github.com/effectstream/effectstream/tree/main/templates/zk-cardano)
