# Paima funnel

Paima funnel is a simple object used for reading from the Paima Storage Contract. See [the documentation](../documentation/paima-funnel.md) for more details.

Both Paima funnel and the Paima Contract are currently implemented to be usable on top of EVM-based blockchains.

## Usage

Currently the library is in development, unpublished, and to be
imported and used locally.

## Architecture

- `index.ts` contains the top-level object with the initialization function and the main API endpoints of the funnel (`readData` and `readPresyncData`), responsible for ensuring meaningful inputs, logging the querying and returning an empty list of data on error;
  - the lower functions MUST NOT throw an error on invalid data, or it will cause the whole runtime to loop inifinitely;
- `reading.ts` contains functions for retrieving main blockchain data from the RPC node (block information + user inputs);
- files in `cde\` additionally process CDE data;
- `paima-l2-processing.ts` contains functionality to process user submitted input, including batched inputs;
- files in `verification\` are responsible for providing signature verification functions for their respective chains;
- `utils.ts` contain additional helper functions used only by the funnel.

### Error handling

There are at least two kind of issues the funnel can encounter when processing chain data which need to be processed differently:

- Invalid data on-chain &ndash; as long as the input was read correctly, this _must_ be handled as if the input was not there at all and cannot raise an error that would lead to retries;
- Error while reading data &ndash; usually connection issues, these operations need to be retried. Helper functions can generally handle this by simply throwing (or not catching) an error, on the top-level (funnel's `readData` and `readPresyncData` methods) this can be handled by returning an empty list of data units (rather than a non-empty list of data units containing no data).

Furthermore, each call to the RPC node (calls to `web3.eth.getBlockNumber`, `web3.eth.getBlock` and `[contract].getPastEvents`) should be wrapped in a `timeout`.
