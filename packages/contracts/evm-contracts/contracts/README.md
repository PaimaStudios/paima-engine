# Solidity Contracts

Solidity contracts provided as part of Paima Engine

- [Erc20NftSale](#Erc20NftSale) provides a general role based access control mechanism. Multiple hierarchical roles can be created and assigned each to multiple accounts.
- [GenericPayment](#GenericPayment) is a simpler mechanism with a single owner "role" that can be assigned to a single account. This simpler mechanism can be useful for quick tests but projects with production concerns are likely to outgrow it.
