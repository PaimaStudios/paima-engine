# Paima Node SDK

Node-only portion of the SDK for Paima Engine. This package wraps all other core node-only packages of the Paima SDK, allowing to easily get access to all Paima features with a single dependency. This dependency can be excluded in frontends to compatibility with non-node based environments.

You can find the full docs for Paima [here](https://docs.paimastudios.com/).
