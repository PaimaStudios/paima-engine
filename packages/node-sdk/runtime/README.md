# @effectstream/runtime

The state-machine runtime - the loop that ties sync, state machine,
database, events, and HTTP API together inside an EffectStream node.
Boot it with `init()` then drive it with `start(config)` and your node
is up.

- The state-machine runtime that owns an Effectstream node's process model.
- `init()` once, `start(config)` to run; ties sync, state machine, DB, events, and HTTP API together.
- Used by every template.
- Also reachable through `@effectstream/node-sdk/runtime`.

## Install

```bash
bun add @effectstream/runtime
# or
npm install @effectstream/runtime
```

`@effectstream/runtime` is the canonical import for `init` and `start`,
used directly by every template. The same surface is also reachable
through `@effectstream/node-sdk/runtime` if you prefer the umbrella.

## Standalone usage

This package **owns the node's process model**. You don't pick parts of
it; you call `init()` once at boot and then `start(config)`. The config
brings together everything else:

`init()` and `start()` are Effection operations, so they must be
yielded inside an Effection `main()`:

```typescript
import { main } from "effection";
import { init, start } from "@effectstream/runtime";
import { Stm } from "@effectstream/sm";
import { config } from "./config.dev.ts";

await main(function* () {
  yield* init();

  const gameStm = new Stm(grammar);
  gameStm.addStateTransition("join", function* () { /* ... */ });

  yield* start({
    config,
    appStateTransitions: [gameStm],
    apiRouter: undefined,           // optional Fastify route plugin
    migrations: [],                 // SQL migrations
  });
});
```

While running, the runtime:

- Reads finalized blocks via `@effectstream/sync`.
- Routes batcher inputs through your registered `Stm`s.
- Commits all yielded SQL inside a per-block transaction.
- Publishes lifecycle and app events via `@effectstream/event-server`.
- Serves the optional Fastify API.
- Emits OpenTelemetry traces and logs through `@effectstream/log`.

## Inside EffectStream

`@effectstream/runtime` is the conductor: it doesn't define any chain
integrations or queries itself, but every other node package only gets
exercised when this loop is running. The `StartConfig` shape determines
which DB migrations apply, which state machines fire, and whether the
runtime exposes a Fastify router.

## Empty-block coalescing (catch-up)

The runtime replays one Effectstream block per main-clock tick, each in its
own DB transaction. During a deep catch-up over an idle gap (e.g. an NTP main
chain at one block/second across days), most of those blocks are **empty** — no
on-chain content, no scheduled input, no migration — yet still cost a full
`BEGIN…COMMIT` round-trip.
Empty-block coalescing folds a run of consecutive empty blocks into a **single
transaction** that writes only the run's endpoint. It is **opt-in** and off by
default:

```bash
EFFECTSTREAM_COALESCE_EMPTY_BLOCKS=true
```

The lag threshold that defines "behind the chain tip" defaults to **20× the
main clock's block time** (falling back to 60 s when no `blockTimeMS` is
exposed by the network config). Override it with
`EFFECTSTREAM_LAG_THRESHOLD_MS` (milliseconds), e.g. for chains whose main
clock fires faster than the runtime can keep up with one transaction per block:

```bash
EFFECTSTREAM_LAG_THRESHOLD_MS=30000   # engage coalescing past 30 s of lag
```

Behavior and guarantees:

- **Catch-up only.** Coalescing engages only while behind the chain tip
  (`now - block.timestamp` greater than the lag threshold) and disengages at
  the tip, so steady-state stays one block per transaction.
- **Identical database.** A coalesced sync produces a byte-for-byte identical
  database to a non-coalesced one. Empty blocks already never advance the block
  hash or RNG seed, so only the endpoint's block row and the per-protocol resume
  watermark are written — exactly as the normal path would leave them.
- **Never skips work.** A run is flushed before any block that has on-chain
  content, a migration at its height, or a due block-height/timestamp-scheduled
  input — so nothing that mutates state is ever folded away.
- **Tip stays visible.** If the producer goes quiet on an empty tail, the run is
  flushed on a short idle timeout so the latest height still commits.
- A run is also capped (`MAX_EMPTY_RUN`) to bound transaction size and recovery.

Implementation: [`src/coalesce.ts`](./src/coalesce.ts) (the `createEmptyBlockCoalescer`
coordinator the main loop drives).

## Key exports

- `init()` - `Operation<void>`. One-shot setup: OpenTelemetry, config validation, version pinning. Call before `start`.
- `start(config: StartConfig)` - `Operation<void>`. Run the node loop until cancelled.

Types and helpers re-exported alongside `init` / `start`:

- `DBMigrations` - versioned SQL migrations passed into `start`.
- `StartConfig`, `StartConfigAppStateTransitions`, `StartConfigApiRouter` - `start`'s config types. Templates type-check against these implicitly but don't usually import them by name.
- `PrimitiveConstructor<T>` - extension point for new primitives.
- `VERSION` - `${number}.${number}.${number}` literal type for version pinning.
- Pagination helpers re-exported from `./api/pagination.ts`.

## Examples

The templates under
[`templates/`](https://github.com/effectstream/effectstream/tree/main/templates)
are full working `init()` + `start()` examples. The simplest is
[`templates/minimal/`](https://github.com/effectstream/effectstream/tree/main/templates/minimal).

End-to-end EVM sync test:
