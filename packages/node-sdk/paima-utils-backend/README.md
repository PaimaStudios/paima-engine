# Paima-utils-backend

A simple library containing helper functions for other Paima backend libraries. This distinction is to support the separation of code targeting Node.js specifically from code targeting browsers specifically from code meant for use in both.

You can find the full docs for Paima [here](https://docs.paimastudios.com/). \
**Note**: We generally recommend using [@paima/sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@paima/sdk) instead of this SDK to get all Paima features as a single package.
