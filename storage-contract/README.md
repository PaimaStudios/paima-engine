# Paima Storage Contract

Paima Storage Contract is contract for on-chain storage and retrieval of data chunks for purposes of other Paima components.

Paima Storage Contract is currently implemented to be usable on top of EVM-based blockchains.

## Usage

Currently the library is in development, unpublished, and to be
imported and used locally.

## Development

Install dependencies:

```
npm i
```

If you want to change the Storage smart contract (`./src/contract/Storage.sol`)
you'll further need Truffle (`npm i -g truffle`) and

```
truffle compile
```

Lint:

```
npm run lint
```

### Test Dependencies

First, install [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry), for example by running the following command:

```
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Then, in a new terminal session (or after reloading your `PATH`), run the following:

```
foundryup
```

To test:

```
npm test
```

or

```
forge test
```

To run the tests with a more verbose output, such as including stack traces of failed tests, the following command can be used:

```
forge test -vvv
```

## Deployment

To deploy the contract, you will need the following:

- Prerequisites installed (in particular, `truffle` and `@truffle/hdwallet-provider`),
- The address and private key of an account on the target network with sufficient funds for deploying the contract (the _deployment account_),
- The address of an account on the target network to be marked as the owner of the contract, capable of withdrawing funds (the _owner account_, can be the same as the deployment account).

When the prerequisites are ready, deploy with the following steps (on the Milkomeda testnet):

1. Navigate to the _storage-contract_ directory;
2. Check the contract configuration in `truffle-config.js`, in particular, set the owner address to the address of the owner account;
3. Set the deployment account private key to an environment variable called `PRIVATE_KEY` and export it to child processes, e.g. in Bash, run `export PRIVATE_KEY=...` with your private key (without the `0x` prefix) instead of the ellipsis;
4. Deploy the contract by running `npx truffle migrate --network testnet` and note the address at which the contract was deployed (including the `0x` prefix).

If truffle is installed globally (using the `-g` flag), you can omit the `npx` in the previous command.
To deploy on a different network, add its connection details to `truffle-config.js` and replace `testnet` in the deployment command with the target network's identifier.
